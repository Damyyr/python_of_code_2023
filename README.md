### Naming

Each days, collaborators will create a new file for both challenges using its handle inside the corresponding folder (see below).  
Inputs will be just a text file, but one can make it a `.py` file to have "cleaner" consts.

```
root
|---|---dayX
|---|---|---input.txt
|---|---|---input-<collaborator1_name>.py
|---|---|---<collaborator1_name>.py
|---|---|---<collaborator2_name>.py
```
